            "question": "What are the benefits of cloud migration?",
            "answer": "Cloud migration offers numerous benefits including reduced infrastructure costs through pay-as-you-go pricing, improved scalability to handle traffic spikes, enhanced disaster recovery capabilities, automatic updates and maintenance, global reach with multiple data centers, and increased innovation through access to cutting-edge services. Companies typically see 30-40% cost savings in the long term while gaining significant agility and flexibility."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do you ensure cloud security?",
            "answer": "We implement comprehensive security measures including identity and access management (IAM), data encryption at rest and in transit, network security with VPCs and firewalls, regular security audits and compliance checks, automated backup and disaster recovery, security monitoring and incident response, and compliance with standards like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR. For Swiss clients, we can utilize data centers in Switzerland to meet stringent local requirements."
          },
          {
            "question": "Should I use single cloud or multi-cloud?",
            "answer": "The choice depends on your requirements. Single cloud offers simplicity, easier management, and deeper integration with platform services. Multi-cloud provides vendor independence, reduced lock-in risk, the ability to use best-of-breed services from each provider, and improved disaster recovery across cloud providers. We help you evaluate factors like existing infrastructure, specific service requirements, compliance needs, and team expertise to determine the best approach. Multi-cloud strategies require careful planning with open standards and proper architecture."
          },
          {
            "question": "How long does cloud migration take?",
            "answer": "Migration timelines vary based on complexity and scope. A simple application migration might take 4-8 weeks, while enterprise-wide migrations typically require 3-12 months. We follow a phased approach: assessment and planning (2-4 weeks), pilot migration (4-6 weeks), incremental migration of remaining workloads, and optimization. This approach minimizes disruption and allows you to realize benefits early while managing risk effectively. We work closely with your team to develop a realistic timeline based on your specific requirements."

It's important because it helps break down data silos, make informed decisions, optimize processes, ensure compliance, and ultimately gain competitive advantages. Without a strategy, data often remains untapped potential or can even lead to inefficiencies and risks."

It enables more efficient operations, better customer knowledge, and faster responses to market changes – often with fewer resources than large corporations. A data strategy tailored to SMEs ensures that data investments are targeted and deliver maximum benefit."

            "answer": "The choice depends on your requirements. Native apps (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) offer the best performance and access to all platform features, making them ideal for complex apps or those requiring cutting-edge features. Cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter are excellent for faster time-to-market and when you want to maintain a single codebase. We'll help you evaluate factors like budget, timeline, required features, and target audience to make the best choice."

PWAs work on any device with a web browser, can be installed on the home screen, work offline, send push notifications, and update automatically. They're cost-effective because you maintain one codebase for all platforms, and users don't need to download them from app stores. PWAs are ideal for content-heavy apps, e-commerce, and when you want to reach users across all platforms efficiently."

            "question": "How long does it take to develop a mobile app?",
            "answer": "Development timelines vary based on app complexity. A simple app with basic features can take 2-3 months, while a medium-complexity app with custom features and backend integration typically requires 4-6 months. Complex apps with advanced features, third-party integrations, and sophisticated backends may take 6-12 months or more. We use agile methodologies to deliver working software incrementally, so you'll see progress throughout the development process and can start testing early versions."

We can provide ongoing maintenance contracts or on-demand support based on your needs. Our support services ensure your app stays current with the latest platform requirements, maintains optimal performance, and continues to delight your users long after launch."

Rather than trying to predict all future requirements upfront, evolutionary architectures embrace change and make it easy to modify the system over time. This approach uses principles like strong bounded contexts, advanced DevOps practices, and automated testing to enable safe, continuous evolution of the software."

          {
            "question": "When should I consider microservices architecture?",
            "answer": "Microservices are ideal when you need high scalability, independent deployment of different business capabilities, or have multiple teams working on different parts of the system. They're particularly valuable for complex domains that benefit from clear separation of concerns and when you need to use different technologies for different services. However, they add operational complexity, so they're best suited for organizations ready to invest in DevOps practices and distributed systems management."

          {
            "question": "How do you ensure our architecture remains flexible?",
            "answer": "We design architectures with flexibility in mind by using principles like loose coupling, strong cohesion, and clear boundaries between components. We employ patterns like Domain-Driven Design to align software structure with business domains, use cloud-native approaches for scalability, and implement comprehensive automated testing to enable safe refactoring. Regular architecture reviews and continuous improvement practices ensure the architecture evolves with your business needs."

          {
            "question": "What's the difference between cloud-native and cloud-ready?",
            "answer": "Cloud-ready applications can run in the cloud but may not fully leverage cloud capabilities. Cloud-native applications are specifically designed to take advantage of cloud computing frameworks – they're built for scalability, resilience, and agility. Cloud-native architectures typically use microservices, containers, dynamic orchestration, and DevOps practices. They enable you to experiment with innovative services, scale automatically based on demand, and achieve higher resilience through distributed architectures."
